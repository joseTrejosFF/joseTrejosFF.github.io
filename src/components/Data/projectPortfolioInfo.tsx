Let me show you what I mean.',

      'I remember the struggle when I was creating the front-end of a big website with only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There was a lot of duplicate code everywhere, new changes were difficult to implement, in other words, maintainability was a pain.',
      "Then my wife told me, “you should use React!” (yeap, she's also a software developer) and I did take her advice. It took me a while to learn it, and it has been my de facto front-end library since then.",
      "Along the way I have found really good tools that make working with react even better like Style-Components. CSS is beautiful and if you combine it with JavaScript in a component based fashion you'll get the most beautiful and reusable CSS ever. A good looking application is key, and to achieve this is an efficient way I picked Styled components.",
